# hello-world
Let's begin!

Hi,guys! I am new to Programming, but i hope i can finally do something here. I need to learn the skills to fulfill my dream. It is hard for a 30-year-old guy who has never learned about coding to take the first step in this scientific area. Yes, it is hard for me. But, "the best time to plant a tree was a decade ago, followed now", and now I am planting my life here. It's now or never.
